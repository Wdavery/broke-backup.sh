# broke-backup.sh

***broke-backup.sh*** was born out of necessityâ€”sometimes you cannot afford to backup all of your data. The first thing that gets excluded from a backup is large, replaceable data such as *Linux ISOs*. :skull_and_crossbones:

This script is meant to give a little bit of security to that replaceable data by recording the directory contents using a standard Unix command: [tree](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/). It will output these trees to a user-defined backup folder, and will email monthly archived backups to cover catastrophic loss.

If you're unfamiliar with `tree`, don't worry; this script takes care of the most common use-cases for you. The core concept is that it recursively lists directory contents, and can be output to a text file. For advanced users, it has many custom options you can find at its [man page](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/tree.1.html). 

**Disclaimer:** Despite the 'backup' in the name, this will not protect your data. This is essentially a disaster recovery assistant. If/when disaster strikes, you may lose your files, but you will know exactly *what* you lost.

#### Example Tree Output

This example is a movie folder set to a depth of 2 (list the `Movies` folder and the contents of it's direct sub-folders; `1` and `2`). In this script, this text is output to `Movies.txt`

#### Example Backup Folder

This is my personal backup folder, that has been running since October 2020. It backs up 6 locationsâ€”14 TiB of 40k filesâ€”into a 4.2 MiB Backup directory. A single archived backup is ~60 KiB.

It keeps 14 days worth of "live" backups, and archives a single backup monthly, indefinitely.

### Usage

##### Dependencies:

- `tree`

- `mutt` - *must have a working configuration*

- `xz-utils`

##### Configuration

There are 7 basic options:

```bash
BACKUP="/path/to/backup/directory"
EMAIL=mail@example.com
SUBJECT="Your Backup Has Arrived! ðŸ’¾"
FOLDERS=(\
"/path/to/include" \
"/path/to/backup" \
"/another/path")
DEPTH=(1 2 3)
MONTHLY="Another month, another set of backups:"
FORCED="Monthly emails aren't enough for you?!\nHere's your backup:"
```

- `BACKUP` - Output directory for backup

- `EMAIL` - Recipient email address

- `SUBJECT` - The subject for sent emails

- `FOLDERS` - A list of folders to backup 

- `DEPTH` - Depth settings for the above folders

- `MONTHLY` - The body of the monthly backup email

- `FORCED` - The body of the forced backup email

###### Advanced Tree Settings

For advanced users, you can specify custom tree options per folder. Setting `USE_CUSTOM` to `TRUE` will override the `DEPTH` settings in the basic config.

```bash
USE_CUSTOM=TRUE
CUSTOM_OPTIONS=("-d -L 1" "-a" "-a -L 4")
```

#### Scheduling

broke-backup.sh relies a daily job schedule. It could run less often, or purely on a manual basis and will work just fine.

Suggested config is to set a cron job to run the script daily, shortly after midnight. My personal config runs every day at 00:25

### Logic Overview

The script has been written to be self-documented and should be fairly easy to follow but it's overall flow is:

1. **if** today's backup already exists, send a forced backup email
   
   - You may want this for two reasons:
     
     - You've just started using broke-backup.sh and want an off-location backup before the 1st of the month rolls around
     
     - Testing your configuration

2. **else** run today's backup to the user-defined backup folder

3. **if** today is the 1st of the month, send a monthly backup email

4. Archive 1st of month backups into the `/Archives` sub-directory as `.tar.xz`

5. Delete backups older than 2 weeks

### Current Limitations

- Two folders cannot have the same name
  
  - `/example/media/path` and `/example/cloud/path` will both output to **`path.txt`**â€”the second backup will overwrite the first

- File modification times of the backup will be fudged
  
  - When a backup is finished, it is backdated to 00:00 of the current day so the cleanup logic works consistently.
