# Version 1.1
#
# This script is designed to maintain a tree-style .txt backup of specified folders.
# By default, it will keep daily backups for 14 days and archive monthly backups indefinitely (as .tar.xz).
# On the first of the month it will email a .tar.xz archive as an extra backup location. 
#
# File modification times will be set to 00:00 of the current day for ease of backup directory maintenance.
